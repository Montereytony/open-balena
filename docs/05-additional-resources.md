# Additional resources

Once you have openbalena up and running, check out these resources. Since balenaCloud is built on top of openbalena, their core concepts and functionality are identical. This means you can refer to the [balenaCloud documentation][documentation]. The following sections are of particular interest:

- [Overview / A balena primer](https://balena.io/docs/learn/welcome/primer)
- [Overview / Core Concepts](https://balena.io/docs/learn/welcome/concepts)
- [Overview / Going to production](https://balena.io/docs/learn/welcome/production-plan)
- [Develop / Define a container](https://balena.io/docs/learn/develop/dockerfile)
- [Develop / Multiple containers](https://balena.io/docs/learn/develop/multicontainer)
- [Develop / Runtime](https://balena.io/docs/learn/develop/runtime)
- [Develop / Interact with hardware](https://balena.io/docs/learn/develop/hardware)
- [Deploy / Optimize your builds](https://balena.io/docs/learn/deploy/build-optimization)
- [Reference](https://balena.io/docs/reference)
- [FAQ](https://balena.io/docs/faq/troubleshooting/faq)

Our team and community keep the balenaCloud docs up to date consistently, so anything new that affects our enterprise users will be documented there and usable by everyone. The only exclusions would be docs that represent balenaCloud-only features, like HostOS updates and organizational control/role-based access.
