# openbalena roadmap

OpenBalena is currently in beta. While fully functional, it lacks features we
consider important before we can comfortably call it production-ready. During
this phase, don’t be alarmed if things don’t work as expected just yet (and
please let us know about any bugs or errors you encounter!). The following
improvements and new functionality is planned:

- Full documentation
- Full test suite
- Simplified deployment
- Remote host OS updates
- Support for custom device types
